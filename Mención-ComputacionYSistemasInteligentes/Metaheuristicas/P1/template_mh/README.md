# C++ Template for Metaheuristics

C++ Template of practices in the course Metaheuristics in the course of Computer Science degree at the University of Granada.

This is a skeleton of the C++ for doing the practices, para 

The main design criteria applied were: 

- To clearly separate the problem part from the algorithm 
- To make easier to change the algorithm maintaining the same API, see the main code.
- To identify the files parts to maintain fixed (in **/common** directory) for the files to be adapted.
- To facilitate the creation of automatic tests.
